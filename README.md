# Raft Consensus Algorithm

This is an implementation of the [Raft Algorithm](https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf) done for UVA's CS 4740: Cloud Computing class in the 2024 Fall semester.
The impelmentation is done in Golang. 

To test the code, enter the following commands in a Linux CLI. 
The project was tested on an Ubuntu-22.4 instance and a Zeus Linux instance.
```bash
$ export "GO111MODULE=off"
$ export GOPATH="$PWD"
$ cd src/raft
$ go test
```
